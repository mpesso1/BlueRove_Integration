DIRECTORY ORGANIZAION

    Data is stored by the date: /Storage/Month/Day

    Each day consist of a Notes.txt file for important observations, and a Paths folder for storing paths generated

    Each path generated within the paths folder should be named in ascending order starting at path1.txt

    Additional data stored should be stored in the Day folder where notes is stored.

STORING PATH DATA

    The path and object locations should be the output of the pp_node.  In order to get the output data into the corect file use linux redirecting
        $ rosrun blue_rov_custom_integration pp_node > Storage/1/31/Paths/path1.txt
        The > symbol signifies redirection of data. 
        ** You must be carfule with this operator. 
            -: > will clear data currently in path1.txt and replace it with new directed data. (This is what we want)
            -: >> Will not clear data and will just add directed data at the end of what is already there. (Dont want this. Will not work with plotter)
            -: < Will Do the compete oposite, taking what ever is in path1.txt and directing it to pp_node (Be carful)
            -: << Makes computer explode

            * Additonally if you put nothing in front of ">" i.e. 
            $ > Storage/1/31/Paths/path1.txt 
            then it will empty the file. This can be handy, but also cautious. Ofcouse can be fixed with Ctlr+z.

    More generally the directory definition coming after ">" is a local directory. Therefore I would sugest being in the blue_rov_custom_integration folder
    when you make the call. 

PLOTTING DATA  
    
    The PlotResults.py file in /Storage contains a script to plot the data out of the file of your choosing.

    In order to sync the script with the file containing data simply define the data and file name in the two variable at the begining of the script.

    Look at comments at begining of script osn possible errors
